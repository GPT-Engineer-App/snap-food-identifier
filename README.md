# snap-food-identifier

App Overview
The application allows users to snap pictures of their food and instantly receive information about the ingredients contained within. The interface will be intuitive and easy to navigate, using visual cues and colors to guide the user through the process from photo capture to ingredient analysis.

UI Design
Main Design: Use a light background throughout the app to create a clean, inviting space.
Text Styling: Employ black for primary text and grey for secondary information, ensuring readability.
Accent Colors: Blue violet will be used for primary action items like buttons, and interactive elements to guide the user's actions.
Layout and Components
Header
Content: Includes a simple logo on the left and a settings icon on the right, both using black or blue violet to maintain consistency.
Styling: A subtle shadow under the header to create depth, enhancing the app’s modern feel.
Main Function Area
Photo Upload Section:
Behavior: Users tap a central camera icon to either take a new photo or upload from their gallery.
Styling: The camera icon is highlighted in blue violet with a minimalist design. Surrounding space is kept free of clutter to focus user attention on the action.
Ingredient Analysis Display
Behavior: Once a photo is uploaded, the app analyzes it and displays ingredients in a card format below the image.
Layout: Ingredients are listed in individual cards that users can tap to expand for more information.
Styling: Cards have a slight elevation with rounded corners, using grey text for ingredient names and blue violet for detailed information links.
Detailed Information Modal
Behavior: Tapping on an ingredient card opens a modal with detailed information about that ingredient, including dietary benefits or risks.
Styling: Modal uses a white background with text in black for primary information and grey for secondary details. Important tags or warnings use the accent color.
Footer
Content: Includes tabs for Home, Discover (to explore other user uploads or popular findings), and Profile.
Styling: Background in white with iconography in grey, highlighted in blue violet when active.
Additional Features
Interactive Tutorials:
Purpose: To assist new users with interactive guides on how to use the app effectively.
Styling: Utilize overlay tutorials with blue violet highlights directing users on steps to take a picture and check ingredient details.
Social Sharing Options
Behavior: Allow users to share their findings on social media directly from the ingredient detail modal.
Styling: Social media icons are styled in subtle grey or black, becoming vibrant when tapped.
Accessibility Considerations
Ensure text contrasts sufficiently against the background for readability.
Buttons and interactive elements are large enough to be easily tapped, with clear labels for accessibility.
